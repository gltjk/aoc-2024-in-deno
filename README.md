A collection of solutions for Advent of Code 2024 implemented using Deno and TypeScript.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> All solutions in this repository are created entirely by human without any AI assistance, respecting the spirit of Advent of Code and its competitive leaderboard. This aligns with [the creator's request to maintain fair competition and genuine learning experience](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about).

## Features

- üöÄ Powered by Deno runtime
- üìù Automatic daily puzzle input fetching
- üîÑ Automatic solution template generation
- ‚ö° TypeScript type support
- üõ†Ô∏è Optimized VSCode development environment

## Prerequisites

- [Deno 2.x](https://deno.com/)
- Valid [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) account
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or compatible editor

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.

2. Obtain your Advent of Code session token:
   - Log in to the [Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com/).
   - Open your browser's developer tools (usually by pressing F12 or right-clicking and selecting "Inspect").
   - Go to the "Application" tab and find the "Cookies" section.
   - Locate the cookie named `session` and copy its value.

3. Copy the environment template file `.env.example` and rename it to `.env`. Then edit the `.env` file, replacing `your_session_token_here` with your actual AOC session token.

## Usage

Run a solution for a specific day:

```bash
deno task solve --day <day_number>
```

For example, to run day 1 solution:

```bash
deno task solve --day 1
```

If the solution for the specified day doesn't exist yet, the command will automatically:

1. Generate a new solution template file
2. Download the puzzle input for that day
3. Create the basic structure for you to implement your solution

This allows you to quickly start working on new daily challenges without manual setup.
